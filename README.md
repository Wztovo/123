# Dual-Source Metric-Based Multi-Client Membership Inference Attack (DSM-MIA)

Official implementation of the paper:  
**"Dual-Source Metric-Based Multi-Client Membership Inference Attack in Federated Learning"**

## 🌟 Overview
This repository provides the official implementation of **DSM-MIA**, a novel membership inference attack designed for **federated learning (FL)**.  
Unlike traditional MIAs that only determine whether a sample was used in training, DSM-MIA **identifies which specific client** in FL owns the sample.

- 🔄 Time-series modeling via RNN/Transformer with attention  
- 🧮 Multi-class attack (member + client attribution)  
- 📈 Comprehensive evaluation across datasets and baselines
